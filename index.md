## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ncont021/GitHubFundamentals/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

## Code 
There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: 
`example = false`.  
If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
